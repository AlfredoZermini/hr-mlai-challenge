# ML/AI Engineer - Challenge 03

Please provide the description of the procedure to analyze [provided land](https://public.17tons.tech/#/land/5) and define an algorithm that can be used to find the best location to deploy sensors for the most accurate monitoring possible in consideration of cost-effectiveness, land conditions and evolutions for the prevention of undesirable effects.

Raw data of land is available at [https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/lands/5](https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/lands/5) and tree positions are available at [https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/trees/land/5](https://nft.17tons.tech/explorer/trees/land/5).

The primary objective of this exercise is to assess your proficiency in constructing a comprehensive model. Emphasis is placed on your capacity to discern relevant variables and incorporate them into a cohesive model that could be applied. We are not interested in the practical implementation of it. Instead, we are keen on observing your adeptness in identifying key parameters and formulating a model that streamlines the determination of the optimal soil moisture sensor placement. This placement should guarantee the accurate measurement of a representative sample, reflective of the broader characteristics of the land.

To facilitate this process, we encourage you to conduct some research. This approach will aid you in formulating your assumptions.
