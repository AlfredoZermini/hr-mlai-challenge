Land conditions data could be used to identify areas where sensor deployment is feasible and 
likely to provide accurate readings.
Optimization techniques to find the optimal number and locations of sensors based on cost-effectiveness and accuracy goals.
This might involve mathematical optimization algorithms.

As for the specifications of the humidty sensors, the resolution of 0.001 m³/m³ allows for
precise measurements, which can be crucial for applications that require fine-grained 
monitoring of soil moisture.
The dielectric measurement frequency of 70 MHz is chosen to optimize the sensor's 
sensitivity to changes in water content.


-Studying the models
Trees could be spatially grouped using the K-means algorithm, based on geographical proximity.
Each cluster could be individually studied, as well as  cost-effectiveness of deploying sensors 
in different clusters. If tree conditions change or new preventive measures are introduced, 
the model should dynamically adjust sensor placements.
Since we have precise data available about each tree, this could be used for model training.
Neural networks such as CNNs could be used to identify patterns and changes in the aerial
photos. For instance, the YOLO model in challenge-01 could be fine-tuned on aerial images.
To train the model, we may need ground-truth of previous obeservations, to assess the conditions of the
trees, such as the trees photos over time, the correspondent soil variables here provided in
challenge-03, and an annotation by an expert (i.e. "trees developing desease", "soil too dry").
Other types of annotations and model predictions, could be the following:

1-Visual Symptoms:
-leaf color changes (discoloration, yellowing, browning), 
-leaf size abnormalities
-leaf shape abnormalities
-foliage density and thinning
-bark abnormalities (lesions, discoloration)
-cankers (areas of dead tissue on bark)
-presence of fungi or mushrooms

2-Physiological Indicators:
-premature leaf drop or excessive shedding
-abnormal growth patterns (stunted growth, excessive branching)
-assessing root condition for signs of disease
-monitoring water uptake and soil moisture levels
-checking for nutrient deficiencies or excesses
-infestation by insects or pests
-abnormal levels of resin or sap

3-Environmental Conditions:
-monitoring temperature, humidity, and precipitation
-direct testing for pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi)

The model could then be used to trigger warning and take proper actions. 
For example, moisture could be used to assess if the soil is wet or dry, thus taking
proper actions, such as regulating irrigation.
