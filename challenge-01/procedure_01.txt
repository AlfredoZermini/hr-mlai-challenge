We could utilize YOLO for aerial tree counting, in a similar manner as 
done in this publication:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17538947.2023.2173318

The main tasks for the procedure:
-Gather aerial images containing trees, ensuring diversity.
-Annotate images with tree bounding boxes using annotation tools.
-Resize images to fit YOLO input requirements.
-Modify YOLO configuration files based on the custom dataset.
-Split data, train the model on the labeled images to detect and count trees.
-Assess model performance on a validation set; adjust parameters as needed.
=Use the trained model to detect and count trees in new aerial images.
-Refine the count by setting confidence thresholds or applying clustering algorithms.

I did write a script which uses YOLOv8. However, the pre-trained model was not trained
on aerial images. Thus, it does not perform any detection. 
The model would need to be fine-tuned on such dataset.

More specifically, this link provides a sort of walkthrough on how to implement this on YOLO v8
