After deleting the NaNs and fixed values (i.e. '0', '-99', as they do not seem to represent a
meaningful physical quantity), I was left with several columns containing humidities.

Plotting them against time reveals some sort of correlation. More specifically, the trend 
is similar. This is also confirmed by using the corr() function, as the correlation values are
close to 1., indicating a strong correlation.

Battery (V) does not seem to provide any meaningful correlation with the other data. 
I also tried plotting this one vs time and humidities, but I could not visually 
identify any trend. 
However, the histogram shows that the battery worked at 4.25 V most of the time, while
fewer times the voltage was lower. Maybe this should investigated, as it could point to a
battery malfunctioning.

Sensor IDs and descriptions seem to be fixed for all the data points, thus I did not include
them in the plots.

At last, to double check that I did not miss any correlation in the discarded quantities,
I decided to display the correlation for the discarded values as well (i.e. 0, -99).
No meaningful correlation was found.
